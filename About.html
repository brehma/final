                OK, A bit about me: &nbsp;&nbsp; I hold an Aeronautical-Astronautical Engineering degree from the University of Washington, specializing as much
                as was possible at the time, in spacecraft design. &nbsp; I then did a stint as an officer in the USAF for 8.5 years. &nbsp; During that time
                I did contracting for and supervised launch crews at Cape Canaveral, FL, to launch our Secret Program satellite.  &nbsp; Well, not so
                secret now. &nbsp; It's been declassified and was known as the Defense Support Program. &nbsp; Basically nuclear launch notification satellites.
                &nbsp; After that I did some intel work during the original Desert Storm then got out during the big draw down after the Berlin wall fell.
                &nbsp; At that point, I went into computer programming and did Masters of Science work at Western Washington University. &nbsp; Worked in the
                industry for 14+ years then got out to pursue other interests and take care of my ailing mother. &nbsp; Now, 10 years later, I'm trying to
                get back into the Tech industry. &nbsp; That 10 years out of it though is a tough sell, so I'm at the end of my first quarter at Bellevue College
                to get a certificate in Programming for the web and mobile devices. &nbsp; It should get me at least looked at and gives me modern experience in those fields.
                &nbsp;If all else fails, I've a mobile game I'm itching to create so we will see!
